Why are several different installs needed to be able to program in Java, as opposed to one large install that has everything you need in there?

Similarly, what is the Java Virtual Machine? Is it similar to an OS VM, like an Ubuntu VM, for instance?

Why would Java need an SDK? It seems to be one of the only programming languages to require it, as most mainstream SDKs are for OS development or game development.

Does Java have any languages to which it is similar syntactically/functionally? The main example I'm thinking of here is the C family of languages, which vary in functionality and syntax, but are still very similar to each other.

Would it be possible to do all of this in one file, or at least have a smaller number of files? At any rate, splitting this up is probably better for readability, as 12 short files reads better than one massive file.

Do other programming languages have the annotations (like @Override)? This is a genuinely useful feature!
